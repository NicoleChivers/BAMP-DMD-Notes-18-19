# 1. Walk through the components of your application
Give a broad overview of the components that make up your application (you do not need to go
through each line of code).

# 2. Detailed breakdown of one of your significant classes
Open up on of the classes in your application (this will most likely be one of your view controller).
Talk through that class outlining its main purpose and functionality. Talk about its properties and
methods. You do not necessarily need to go through your code line by line.

# 3. Naming & Formatting Conventions
Your project must adhere to good naming conventions. Classes, files, variables and methods
should be named appropriately. This is a really simple professional standard to keep to and can
save confusion in the future - don’t be lazy! Code formatting is good practice and will save you
time in the long run - particularly as your skills at reading code improve.

# 4. Documentation
Your classes must be documented with comments. This will help your understanding and stop
you writing lots of code for no reason. It will also help you with points 2 and 3 of this list.

# 5. Appropriate use of Graphics
If you choose to include image assets in your project, they must be appropriately sized and
formatted. Do not use a 3000px image for a small icon, this creates bloat.

# 6. Explanation & use of Delegates
Delegates are used all over the iOS ecosystem and are an effective design pattern. You will need
to understand how to use them. Briefly talk about what delegation is, its purpose and where you
are using it in your project, which you certainly will be.

# 7. Successful compilation
Your project should compile successfully and run on a simulator. If you need to simulate a location
then this is something you should also demonstrate. 

# 8. Talk about View Controller lifecycle
At this stage, your view controller classes are likely to be where the majority of your code resides.
There are a number of points in the lifecycle of a view controller where you can interact with your
application - briefly talk about these. 

# 9. Use of at least one Cocoapod*
Using external libraries can vastly speed up your development process and is something you’ll
want to take advantage of - if not for this project, certainly in the future.

# 10. Version Control*
Your project must be version controlled on GitHub. Version control software is an effective way to
backup your project and is vital for collaboration on projects of this nature. It’s something you’ll
need to commit to using from the beginning.
